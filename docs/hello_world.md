# Hello World!

Let's instantly jump into the most complicated program in programming history!

```
print("hello world!")
```

Just like in Python or Lua, printing text to the terminal is a simple one-liner. This is made possible due to the standard library being written in the native language Rust. The standard library, which is put in the global scope at the start of every Lu interpreter, has a lot more functions than just `print(...)` of course: It has error functions like `error(msg)` or `assert(cond)`, vector and object manipulation with the modules `vec` and `obj` etc.
